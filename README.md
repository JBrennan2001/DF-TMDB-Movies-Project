# DF TMDB Movies Project
This was a solo project where I was required to use Python to draw insights from a dataset containing movie information. I presented my findings in a Python markdown notebook. This was the first time that I used the Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries in Python for a project.

## Project Description
I was given a dataset by my Digital Futures instructor and I was asked to freely explore the data and draw insights from it using the Pandas library in Python. However, there were still a few deliverables expected. These were:
* 3 Python visualisations showcasing insights drawn from the data,
* 2 key points drawn from the data, explicitly stated in a Markdown format and explained by my code and findings,
* to select 2 movies on which to provide a more in-depth single observation analysis.

These were just the minimal requirements for the project so I was able to freely explore and analyse anything I found interesting in the data. To create the visualisations I used the Seabron and Matplotlib libraries in Python.
